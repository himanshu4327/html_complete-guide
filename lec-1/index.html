<!-- here  <html> content </html> is a root element because parents of this element is not present -->

<!-- here we write our code in this body that is going to show in web page   -->

<!-- The <head> element in HTML is used to contain metadata and other non-visible information about a web page. It does not display any content directly on the web page itself but instead provides important information and settings for the browser and search engines -->

<!-- The <body> element in HTML is one of the most important elements within an HTML document. It defines the main content area of a web page, and all the visible content, including text, images, links, and interactive elements, is placed inside the <body> element. The <body> element is a child of the <html> element and typically follows the <head> element in the HTML structure. -->
